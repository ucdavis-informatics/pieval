## Demo Title and Copy
Title: PieVal - Accelerating label capture for Natural Language Processing 
Copy: PieVal, combining the words Python and Validation, is a web-based, secure, text data labelling tool designed for distributed annotation of sensitive data supporting document level annotations and captures binary and multi-class labels.  It is designed to be part of an iterative continuous improvement cycle by reframing the labelling process as an assertion test, which also had the side effect of accelerating annotation capture significantly.  This reframing provides a consistent interface regardless of class number or project stage.  Additional features include the ability to directly test the impact of text enrichment strategies on both annotation times as well as downstream model performance.
